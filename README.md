# CSF.Ind: Climate Smart Forestry Indicators Generator
üåé‚õ∞Ô∏èüå≥üå≤ **CSF.Ind** is a user-friendly Shiny web application designed to calculate Climate Smart Forestry (CSF) indicators using proximal data (e.g., field surveys or remote forest inventory data). This tool is tailored for European forests and supports decision-making in forest management under Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) criteria.

### üöÄ Overview
CSF.Ind calculates the following indicators for forest stands:
- Growing stock and carbon stock.
- Lying deadwood and standing deadwood.
- Structural and species diversity variables.
This web-based app is applicable to all European forests and is designed to support forest management under the Climate Smart Forestry (CSF) concept.

### üéØ Objective
The primary objective of CSF.Ind is to provide a robust and user-friendly tool for calculating CSF indicators using validated procedures from the Forwards project. The app aims to:
- Simplify the calculation of CSF indicators for users without coding expertise.
- Support decision-makers in forest management under Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) criteria.
- Align with the Climate Smart Forestry (CSF) concept.

### üìö Reference
The computation of CSF.Ind is based on local datasets and validated procedures. For more details, refer to the following publication:

### üõ†Ô∏è CSF.Ind Web Application Configuration
#### Choose CSF Pillar
Users can select between two pillars:
- Mitigation: Includes growing stock, carbon stock, lying deadwood, standing deadwood, and an all-deadwood option (computed using double-pair diameter measurements).
- Adaptation: Includes 20 structural and species diversity indicators.

#### Upload Excel File
Users can upload an Excel file (.xlsx) containing the required data for the selected CSF indicators. Refer to Table 1 in the app for the specific data requirements.

#### Forest Management Intensity (ForMainInt)
Users can choose whether to provide Forest Management Intensity information for each plot (Yes or No). If Yes is selected, users must specify the column containing this information.

#### Single vs. Multi-Plot Analysis
Users can choose between single-plot or multi-plot analysis (Yes or No). If Yes is selected, users must specify the column containing the PlotID information.

#### Requested Data
After selecting the CSF pillar and indicator, the app will display the required data inputs. Users can select the appropriate column names from a drop-down menu.

#### Download Outputs
- Download Table ForMainInt (.xlsx): Download the output values for Forest Management Intensity.
- Download Table Plot (.xlsx): Download the output values for individual plots.
- Download Report (.pdf): Download a PDF report summarizing the analysis.

#### Run Analysis
The CSF.Ind analysis is automatically computed once all required inputs are provided.

### üì• Installation and Usage
Install R and RStudio (if not already installed).
Run the following code in RStudio to launch the app:
